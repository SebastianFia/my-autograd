# my-autograd

My Python implementation of the *Autograd* algorithm, which sits at the core of libraries such as *PyTorch* and *Tensorflow*.
This is an unoptimized and simplified version that works only for scalar values, not for tensors.
In the nn.py we implement a MLP, on which we can do backpropagation thanks to autograd.py.
